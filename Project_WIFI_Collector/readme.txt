The project has been carried out by √Ålvaro Vos Gracia and Ana Foncubierta. 
Created in approximately 6 hours each this was done by sharing all the working hours 
and trying to make the code together. 

First meeting: Friday 22 15:00-18:00, stablishing the working plan and implementing the file dym_struct_arr.c 
Second meeting: Monday 25 16:00-18:00, changing to whole code to the dynamic array and doing wc_delete_net 
Final meeting: Thursday 4 16:00-17:00,  reviewing for errors and commenting on the program,
trying to follow the templates.

Some important aspects of the project are:

1. The program has been divided into mainly three c files: dym_struct_arr.c, wc_base.c with its respective headers
files and the main.c. The dym_struct_arr.c which allows to interactuate with the dynamic structure array, the wc_base.c 
which is used to perform the menu operations and the main.c which is the one describing and performing 
the program itself.

2. Establishing the cell directory (in the folder where the other files are), in order to avoid confusions
of the directory
